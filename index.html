<h1> Console Project </h1>
<p> Visual Code Studio is a type of IDE which we use in coding classes to learn and create our projects. To set up a project, you must create a folder on your desktop and then on the homepage click "Open File". After this you can click on the "New File" icon to add your HTML, CSS, or JS code. That's it! </p>
<p> A console screen is a screen that shows all of your recorded code that you have scripted. A console screen is important to use because it helps us keep track of what all code has been written and in case if there are any mistakes, you can easily find out through the console screen. To open a console screen on a webpage you can simply right-click and select "Inspect". Once you do that you can navigate to the console screen. To print something on the console screen, you type "console.log" and next to that () (parentheses). </p>
<script>
    var first_name = "Avika";
var last_name = "Prasad";
var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);
var a = 5;
var b = 6;
var total = a + b;
console.log(total);
